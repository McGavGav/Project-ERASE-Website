## What's New
* Created a barebones website from Django framework.

## Work Summary
The main work done for the sprint was establishing a relationship with the client, and holding meetings in order to get their input on their needs for the website, as well as discuss ideas and see what features the client has a positive response to. Requirements, use cases, and user stories were built off of those planning meetings into formal documentation for the team to build off of and start developing the website. The team also decided on a framework for the project, and setup a rudimentary website to show some development progress.

## Unfinished Work
We did not get to the actual backend development for the project in this sprint. The reasoning is that there was a significant amount of research and planning put in before development can begin, ensuring that the planned features are to the client's satisfaction before building them, as well as doing research on website frameworks, database systems, and hosting services for long-term upkeep. Now that the initial research is done, the focus of the next sprint is to build the highest priority features as determined from the requirements gathering stage.

## Completed Issues/User Stories
None.

## Incomplete Issues/User Stories
The Kanban board with relevant issues for the project will be setup as development begins in Sprint 2, so for now, the user stories are based on the Requirements and Specifications Document. All user stores are incomplete for this reason.
1. US1 - User Registration and Login
2. US2 - Managing Student Information
3. US3 - Viewing and Managing Events
4. US4 - Website Navigation and Information Access
5. US5 - Interacting with the Interactive Map

## Code Files for Review
None.

## Retrospective Summary
Here's what went well:
* The team has met all deadlines and communication has been open.
* The team established a good relationship with the client.
* The client is enthusiastic about the ideas for the project overall.

Here's what we'd like to improve:
* Starting on work for deadlines earlier.
* Providing more consistent and earlier communication rather than the day before.

Here are changes we plan to implement in the next sprint:
* The website page layout for the Calendar, Events, Login, and Student Database
* The secure login system
* User database
* Student database
* Different user types (guest, board member, administrator)
